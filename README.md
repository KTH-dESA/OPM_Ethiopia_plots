# Plotting for OPM Pathways project

To recreate the plots first install conda, then the environment from the opm.yaml file:

    conda create -f opm.yaml

Then run all the cells in the jupyter notebook capacity.ipynb

This was used to create the images found in
[Energy system development pathways for Ethiopia: Work Package 3 Final Report](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4646248).
